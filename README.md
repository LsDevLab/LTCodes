# Fountain Code: Efficient Python Implementation of LT Codes

This project is the implementation in Python of the iterative encoding and iterative decoding algorithms of the [LT Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LT_codes), 
an error correction code based on the principles of [Fountain Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code).

The encoder and decoder are optimized to handle big transfers for files between 1MB to 1GB at high speed.

## How to use it

Usage (python 3.x):
```
python lt_codes.py filename [-h] [-r REDUNDANCY] [--systematic] [--verbose] [--x86]
```

An example describing how to use the implementation is in `lt_codes.py`. However:
* `core.py` contains the Symbol class, constants and functions that are used in both encoding and decoding.
* `distributions.py` contains the two functions that generate degrees based on the ideal soliton and robust soliton distributions
* `encoder.py` contains the encoding algorithm
* `decoder.py` contains the decoding algorithm
* `md5_checker.sh` calls `lt_codes.py` and then compare the integrity of the original file with the newly created file. The integrity check is made with `md5sum.exe`, remove the ".exe" if you work on Unix.

## Benchmarks
The time consumed by the encoding and decoding process is completely related to the size of the file to encode and the wanted redundancy.
I have made some measure on an Intel i5 @ 2.30GHz with a 1.5 redundancy :
